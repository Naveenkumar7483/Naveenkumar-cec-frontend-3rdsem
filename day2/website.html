     <h1>Delicious food in Karnataka</h1>
     <pre>Karnataka cuisine offers diverse flavors,
         from the fiery non-vegetarian dishes of Mangalore and Coorg to the vegetarian staples like bisi bele bath and neer dosa found across the state.
          Staples include rice, millet-based rotis like jowar rotti and ragi rotti, and coconut, tamarind, and jaggery are key flavoring ingredients.
           Must-try items include Mysore Masala Dosa, the lentil-and-vegetable stew bisi bele bath, the sweet coconut fudge Mysore Pak, and the savory rice flour flatbread neer dosa.
